# Wii U Plugin Framework

Wii U Plugin Framework (WUPF) is a framework designed to make it simpler to create WUPS Homebrew apps. It provides an abstraction over [wups](https://github.com/rust-wiiu/wups) by providing commonly needed functionalities in a simple yet powerful, stateful app way.

```rust
struct MyPlugin {
    value: u32
}
```
